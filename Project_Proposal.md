# Medical Appointment Exploratory Data Analysis Project


> ## Introduction
>> In this project, I will be doing Exploratory data analysis for Medical Appointment datasets in Brazil. I plan to find the reason why the patients donâ€™t show up in their appointments. At the end of the project, I plan to have some suggestions that may improve making appointments.

> ## Dataset
>> The datasets I will be using are taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).  This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

 | ------------- | ------------- |
 | patient_id  | ID of the Patient |
 | appointment_id  | ID of the appointment |
 | Gender | Either male of female |
 | secheduled_day | on what day the patient set up their appointment |
 | appointment_day | it is the appointment day |

 | handicap | if the patient are handicap or not. true or false |
 | sms_received | how many messages sent to the patient |
 | no_show | if the patient show up or not. true or false |
 
 > ## Tools
 >> To explore and analyze the data, I will be using different tools such as Jupyter notebook, SQLite. Also, I will use different libraries with python such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

> ## Conclusion
>> To conclude, I expect after analyzing and exploring the data to see the reason of the No Show for the appointments and if there is something forced the patient to not come to the appointment. I plan to have some suggestions that may improve the scheduling of the appointments.
