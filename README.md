# Medical Appointment Exploratory Data Analysis Project


> ## Introduction
>> In this project, I will be doing Exploratory data analysis for Medical Appointment datasets in Brazil. I plan to find the reason why the patients donâ€™t show up in their appointments. At the end of the project, I plan to have some suggestions that may improve making appointments.

> ## Dataset
>> The datasets I will be using are taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).  This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
